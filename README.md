# About
Hitagi is an HTML5 game development framework based on an [Entity-Component-System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) architecture. It's philosophy is to embrace the good parts of JavaScript.

# How does it work?
* **Entities** are our data, made of 'building blocks' called **Components**.
* **Systems** are our code, processing our **Entities** and performing I/O.
* **Worlds** wire **Entities** and **Systems** together.

# Standing on the shoulders of giants
Hitagi wouldn't be possible without some awesome libraries, notably:
* [Pixi.js](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js)
* [Howler](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js/)
