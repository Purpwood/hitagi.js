## About
Hitagi is an HTML5 game development framework that loves to keep your code and data separate. It uses an [Entity-Component-System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) architecture.

## How does it work?
* [Entities](https://github.com/RoganMurley/hitagi.js/wiki/Entity) are our data, made of 'building blocks' called [Components](https://github.com/RoganMurley/hitagi.js/wiki/Component).
* [Systems](https://github.com/RoganMurley/hitagi.js/wiki/System) are our code, updating our [Entities](https://github.com/RoganMurley/hitagi.js/wiki/Entity) and performing I/O.
* [Worlds](https://github.com/RoganMurley/hitagi.js/wiki/World) wire [Entities](https://github.com/RoganMurley/hitagi.js/wiki/Entity) and [Systems](https://github.com/RoganMurley/hitagi.js/wiki/System) together.

## Standing on the shoulders of giants
Hitagi wouldn't be possible without some awesome libraries, notably:
* [Pixi.js](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js)
* [Howler](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js/)
