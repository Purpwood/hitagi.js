# About
Hitagi is a JavaScript/HTML5 game development framework that loves to keep your code and data separate. It uses an [Entity Component System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) architecture.

# How does it work?
* The **World** contains **Entities** and **Systems**.
* **Entities** are our data, made of 'building blocks' called **Components**.
* **Systems** are our code, processing our **Entities** and performing I/O.

# Examples
* [Hello, world!](http://codepen.io/Purpwood/pen/dozPJw?editors=001)
* [Pong](http://codepen.io/Purpwood/pen/LVBdod?editors=001)
* [Flappy Bird](http://codepen.io/Purpwood/pen/xGmOLo?editors=001)
* [Platformer](http://codepen.io/Purpwood/pen/OVeodX?editors=001)
