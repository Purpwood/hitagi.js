# About
Hitagi is a JavaScript game development framework that loves to keep your code and data separate. It uses an [Entity Component System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) architecture.

# How does it work?
* The **World** contains **Entities** and **Systems**.
* **Entities** are our data, made of 'building blocks' called **Components**.
* **Systems** are our code, processing our **Entities** and performing I/O.

# Examples
[Hello, world!](https://github.com/Purpwood/hitagi.js/blob/master/examples/example1/example1.js)

# Contributing
We're currently early in development, so any issues or pull requests are welcome!
